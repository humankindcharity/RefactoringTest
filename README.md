# Refactoring Test

## Description
Your task is to refactor the ReferralsService class using industry recognised coding techniques and principles bearing in mind acronyms such as SOLID, DRY etc.  The business logic in the class is basic and simplified but assume that there are no issues with the logic itself.  If you find any issues with the logic then please make a note and raise these points in the interview.

Please clone this repository and then complete your changes in your own repository and then supply a link to a public repository containing your work no later than the day prior to interview.

## Restrictions
The Program.cs class in the TestAppProgram project should not be changed.  Anything in the TestAppLinrary project can be changed except for the ReferralDataAccess class and the ServiceDataAccess class.
